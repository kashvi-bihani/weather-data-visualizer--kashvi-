#  Weather Data Analysis Project

This project performs an end-to-end analysis of a global weather dataset using Python.  
It includes data loading, cleaning, exploratory statistics, visualizations, seasonal insights, and auto-generated reporting.

# Dataset Description

The dataset used is **GlobalWeatherRepository.csv** containing real-world hourly weather measurements.  
## 1.Detect datetime column automatically 
## 2.Compute daily, monthly and yearly statistics (NumPy) 
## 3.Build multiple visualization plots 
## 4.Group & analyze seasons and months 
## 5.Export cleaned dataset, images & report

##  Tools & Technologies Used
Programming Language  Python 
 Libraries for Data Handling - `pandas`, `numpy` 
 Visualization - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` 
 Export & Reporting - CSV output + Markdown report

##  Results Summary

**Temperature Patterns**  
Daily temperatures show a fluctuating sinus-style behavior with noticeable seasonal variations.

🔹 **Rainfall Patterns**  
Rainfall is not evenly distributed — some months show high rainfall while others show almost none.

🔹 **Humidity vs Temperature Relationship**  
Humidity decreases as temperature increases, indicating an **inverse correlation**.

🔹 **Seasonal Weather Behavior**  
Season-based grouping reveals distinct climate patterns:
- **Winter:** Generally lower temperature & high humidity
- **Summer:** Higher temperatures & lower humidity
- **Rainy months:** Highest precipitation levels
